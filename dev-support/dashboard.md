## &#x20;Brief

Developer support is mostly for people who are just starting or are still learning. This section covers basic concepts, terms, and acronyms you will need to get started.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Creating new cool things is always easier than going back afterwards to document what's already out there. This support section will do its best to remain current, but it is an uphill battle. If you would like to assist keeping this site updated, then please let someone know on [Discord](community-links.md).
