2. Install [Microsoft .NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
3. Install [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/)
4. Install the [Cyberpunk Blender Add-in](https://github.com/WolvenKit/Cyberpunk-Blender-add-on/releases/latest)
5. Install [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/), please refer to [Graphical Editors](../../dev-documentation/tools/graphical-editor/) for comparable software
6. Install [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/), please refer to [Graphical Editors](../../dev-documentation/tools/graphical-editor/) for comparable software

## Optional Quality of Life Steps

1. Create a centralized local for your modding projects. By default WolvenKit creates a folder in `%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\REDModding` that can also act as an okay place for a modding archive.
   * Asset Depot -- `C:\Cyberpunk2077Mod\Depot\`
   * Coding -- `C:\Coding\`
   * Guides and misc notes -- `C:\Cyberpunk2077Mod\Guides\`
   * Modding projects -- `C:\Cyberpunk2077Mod\Projects\`
   * WolvenKit application -- `C:\Cyberpunk2077Mod\WolvenKit\`
2. Create a shortcut to the Cyberpunk game files in the root of your project location
3. Add the following shortcuts to your Start Menu
   * Blender
   * Gimp, or whatever your image editor is
   * Notepad++, or whatever your advanced text editor is
   * Discord
