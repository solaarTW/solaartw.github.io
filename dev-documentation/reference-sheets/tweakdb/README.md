# TweakDB

## What is the Tweak DB? <a href="#what-is-the-tweak-db" id="what-is-the-tweak-db"></a>

Cyberpunk 2077 uses a single static database file which contains data about gameplay elements. This database file can be located at the following path within the Cyberpunk 2077 game installation: `Cyberpunk 2077\r6\cache\tweakdb.bin` This file and the accompanying system Cyberpunk 2077 uses to register and control gameplay elements is called the **Tweak DB**. The Tweak DB is responsible for registering all player-facing items such as vehicles, weapons, and apparel. In other words, to create a new standalone gameplay item mod developers must take advantage of the Tweak DB.

## Modifying the Tweak DB <a href="#modifying-the-tweak-db" id="modifying-the-tweak-db"></a>

The Tweak DB can be interacted with using Cyberpunk's official **REDmod**, or numerous community solutions such as **TweakXL**, **CET**, and **redscript**.
