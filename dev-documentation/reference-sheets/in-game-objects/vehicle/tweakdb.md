# â–« TweakDB

A couple different TweakDB records (also called groups) can be used to create a vehicle. The YAML .tweak files shown the examples here can be processed by [WolvenKit](https://github.com/WolvenKit/WolvenKit) to create a .bin that can be loaded into the game with [TweakDBext](https://github.com/WopsS/TweakDBext). The groups section creates the record, and the flats are automatically generated from that.&#x20;

In addition to adding the record, the `Vehicle.vehicle_list.list` flat (array:TweakDBID) must be updated with the TweakDBID of the new record (Vehicle.vehicle\_template is the TweakDBID of the template, as an example), and `Vehicle.vehicle_list.initially_unlocked_list` (array:TweakDBID) can be added to for that vehicle to be available upon the start of the game.
