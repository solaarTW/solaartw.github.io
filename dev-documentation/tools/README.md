# ðŸ›  Tools

## **Brief**

Before most tools can be used, some form of purchase, download, installation, and configuration must be completed. Even after that is complete, each tool has tips and tricks and lessons learned in order to be successful using them.

{% hint style="info" %}
This section is not about modding, it's about install, configuring, and using the basic functionality of the tool.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
When there is doubt if a document belongs with the tool, reference sheet, or guide, put it with the tool.
