# Dashboard

## Brief

Mod support covers frequently asked questions and problems associated to what software you need to install mods, the different ways to install mods, how you can avoid and deal with conflicts between mods.

Creating new cool things is always easier than going back afterwards to document what's already out there. This support section will do its best to remain current, but it is an uphill battle. If you would like to assist keeping this site updated, then please let someone know on [Discord](community-links.md).
