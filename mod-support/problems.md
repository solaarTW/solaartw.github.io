# ‚ùó Problems

## Brief

Due to the chaotic nature of people and problems, the problems in this section are not listed in any particular order. We will do our best to cater what goes here, but be prepared to read or use your browser's search tool.

### Structure

If the problem requires a sequence of steps then the solution will be numbered and should be followed as step 1, step 2, step 3, etc.. If the problem has multiple possible solutions then the solutions will be in an unordered (aka bulleted) list.

## Problems

1. <mark style="color:red;">Problem</mark>: The game crashes or locks up after adding my mods.
   1. Disable/remove the mod(s) you just installed.
   2. Restart the game and make sure it does not crash.
   3. Install each mod one at a time, and make sure it isn't the mod itself conflicting with your computer or your Cyberpunk install. If you discover one mod crashes the game, then contact the mod developer and see if they can assist you.
2. <mark style="color:red;">Problem</mark>: My favorite item in the game disappeared or changed after installing a mod!
   * Welcome to the world of asset repurposing. Please contact the mod developer and ask them to unlink the mod's assets from the game.
   * Become a mod developer by unbundling the mod and unlink the assets yourself. It's a creative and satisfying hobby that won't make you loss the hair on your head.
3. <mark style="color:red;">Problem</mark>: Nothing happens when I click the Mod Manager Download button on Nexus.
   * The last time you downloaded a mod, you probably checked the popup box to automatically have your mod manager manage the downloads. Please open your mod manager and look at its downloads and active downloads folder.
