# ðŸ”© Tools

## Brief

Vertex has come a long way since the early days of Skyrim modding, and the vast majority of the time you simply need to click the download button on Nexus and everything just works. For those small number of times where that doesn't happen, because the mod was packed incorrectly by the developer, or the mod needs to be extracted to novel locations, you will need a compression utility like 7zip to open the file and place the mod manually. In those cases, the developer will tell you where to put the files but you'll need to read about that wherever you downloaded the mod.

## Tools

If you're reading this section then I'm going to advise that the two tools you need are a compression utility like 7zip, for those rare situations, and a mod manager like Vertex. Please read about installing and using them in the [Tools section](broken-reference) of this wiki.
