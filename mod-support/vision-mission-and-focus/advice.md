## Brief

There are two ways to get a mod into your game:

1. Manually install
2. Mod Manager

It is important to know both ways because:

1. Some utility mods will change the way other mods are loaded into the game, and those utility mods cannot be placed into the correct location by some mod managers,
2. Some mods will conflict with each other, you will need a tools to mandate the load order of those mods. Conflict resolution is not supported by all mod managers, and the ones that do have different levels of support.

## Mod Types

There are generally two kinda of mods, ones that add or change content in the game, and the other that changes the way the game behaves. Generally speaking, mods will always go into either the game directory's .\Cyberpunk 2077\archive or .\Cyberpunk 2077\mods directories, but you will need to keep an eye open for ones that want to install directly into .\Cyberpunk 2077. For mods on the Nexus, that requirement will be mentioned in the mod's description tab.

## Next Steps

The next page will briefly go over what to expect from a mod manager, and then jump down to the Tools section of this wiki to read about installing mods with the Mod Manager versus manually installing them.
