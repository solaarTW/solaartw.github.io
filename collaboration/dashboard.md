# Dashboard

## Brief

Application and object specific documentation that range from reference sheets to step-by-step guides. Each document is tagged with the tool version it was written for and a date when it was written.

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure the document you are following matches the version of the application you're modding in. if it's different then think about creating an updated guide, or asking the author's guide to do it.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
When there is doubt if a document belongs with the tool, reference sheet, or guide, put it with the tool.
{% endhint %}
