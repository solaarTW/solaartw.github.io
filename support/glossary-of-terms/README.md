# ðŸ“„ General Glossary

## Brief

Typical of any mature technical process, modding is filled with concepts, terms, and acronyms that are required learning to understand how to mod. For example understanding the relationship of multilayered assets, or what assets even are. Building your knowledge with the words in this section will help you communicate with other developers about what your needs and challenges are.

{% hint style="info" %}
I do not recommend that you start memorizing words and concepts. This is a technical reference for you to fall back on for additional information.
